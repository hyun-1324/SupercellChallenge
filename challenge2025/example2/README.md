# Supercell Challenge 2024

This is my submission for Hive's coding challenge with Supercell. We were given a basic survival game to be improved and expanded upon. Through this project I vastly improved my fluency with C++ and became very familiar with the SFML library.


## Prerequisites

You must have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.22.1 or later installed to build this project.

If you are on Linux, make sure to install SFML's dependencies. For Debian-based distros:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
    libxrandr-dev \
    libxcursor-dev \
    libudev-dev \
    libfreetype-dev \
    libopenal-dev \
    libflac-dev \
    libvorbis-dev \
    libgl1-mesa-dev \
    libegl1-mesa-dev
```

## Building

Simply run `cmake -B build` and `cmake --build build`. This builds the executable in `./build/bin/`.

The exact location of the executable may differ depending on your system and compiler. Example locations are `./build/bin/survive` and `./build/bin/Debug/survive.exe`.

Alternatively, you can specify a generator suited for your toolchain.
- `cmake -B build -G"Unix Makefiles"`
- `cmake -B build -G"Visual Studio 17 2022"`
- `cmake -B build -GXcode`

Run `cmake -G` to list all available generators.
